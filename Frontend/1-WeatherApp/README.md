**Description:**

You are required to create a web page that displays a simple weather application. The page should fulfill the following requirements:

1. The page must have a header that displays the text "Weather App".
2. Display a form with an input field where the user can enter a city name.
3. Upon submitting the form, retrieve weather data for the entered city using a weather API of your choice. Display the following information for the current weather:
   - Temperature (in Celsius)
   - Weather description
   - Humidity percentage
   - Wind speed (in km/h)
4. If the API request fails or the city name is not found, display an error message indicating that the weather data could not be retrieved.
5. Below the weather information, display an image representing the current weather condition. You can use icons from a free weather icon pack or any other suitable source.
6. Apply CSS styles to make the web page visually appealing and responsive.
7. Ensure that your code follows best practices for readability, organization, and maintainability.
8. Bonus: Implement the ability to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature units.

**Note:**
You are free to choose any weather API you prefer for retrieving weather data. Popular choices include OpenWeatherMap, Weatherbit, and WeatherAPI.
